**I find that creating a simple webpage on HTML** is fairly simple and that's how I was self-motivated learnt the basics.
If you don't know about Google Fonts, please go to fonts.google.com and follow the instructions because you can get great font families there! 
JavaScript is being worked once I've actually learnt the basics. [W3Schools](www.w3schools.com) is a great tutorial place for that!
