# SuperHarmony910! That's me!
**HELLO** and welcome to my GitHub profile! Nice to meet you! This repository is basically my views on programming languages and some tips which I highly recommend to beginner programmers such as myself. (Everyone has trouble with the PATH variable imo!) This will also be where I deploy my main GitHub Pages website from!
