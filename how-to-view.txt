To view .md files, go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en regardless of any browser you are using save Internet Explorer! 

(I mean, come on, who uses an outdated browser like IE?! If you do use an outdated browser, I recommend you switch to Google Chrome. Link to download: https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/
Change the "us" to "au" if in AUstralia, "gb" if in UK, and for all the other countries, go down to the bottom of the page, click on the bottom left "English - United States" and change to your preffered country.
This may make a difference on which download you get!)
