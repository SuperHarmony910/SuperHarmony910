# My experiences with Git

Git is a Linux-based command line by the creator of Linux, **Linus Torvalds**, and nowadays manipulated to commit, push, pull and modify the finer and more subtle areas of GitHub. GitHub Desktop, I do agree, does the job better and cleaner, no need to learn commands and toy around with the command line. The only reason I am using Git Bash is because I have had a GitHub Desktop issue which can be found at <https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/10363>.
