# Welcome to SuperHarmony910's GitHub profile

I am a young, ambitious and mostly self-motivated programmer who is currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, C and C++. I also have an account on [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/15129420), where I started coding, and on [Atlassian](https://superharmony910.atlassian.net)!

## Why do I code  

My desire to commit to open source code was first motivated by **[@MrCrayfish](https://github.com/MrCrayfish)**, who was at the time modding for Minecraft!
(You can learn about why and how I started to code for Minecraft [here.](https://superharmony910.github.io/modification-builder) )

I was inspired by his eternal expertise and creativity, and in November of 2019, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to play around with
some programs and web development and succumbed into the web of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.


Fast forward to January of 2020, I had already dived deep into the cavernous
depths of the Java programming language. In July, I had already captured the basics of the slithery Python language, trying to build programs and GUIs left, right and centre.
Come to now (September 2020), and I am expressing basic interest in executables, therefore leading to my occasional delves into C & C++, Node.js and Go! Not much to come, but definitely worthwile.

### How skilled am I at programming and have I mastered it?
Nobody is *the master* at programming (except maybe the creators); people have different skills which vary to their interests. If, for instance, someone wanted to build a website,
they would not be looking at building a GUI with Tkinter in Python! Although, if you do want to learn programming, you must acknowledge the principles of it and committing to it.
I possess an inquisitive personality and diverse levels of expertise and prowess in various programming languages, which I have displayed in order of personal knowledge below:
