 <p id="paragraph_description"> Note that this digital clock will tell the same time as all devices that establish time from the Internet. In simpler words, it will match as the same time as everything that connects to the Internet and tells time. Thank you for using my digital clock. P.S. I have no idea if it will show the time in my timezone(GMT+10:00 AEST)or yours. Please leave down in the comment below if it works or not. And if anybody would recommend any styles, any colours, a look and a feel, please write down in the comments. Thanks. :) </p>
